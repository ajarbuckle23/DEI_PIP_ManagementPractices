# DEI, PIP, and Management Analyses Project 

## Summary

In this project, I made use of a fictitious employee dataset to answer critical business questions across several topics

### Management Practices

* How do and job performance, engagement levels, and satisfaction levels vary for employees under different managers?

### Performance Improvement Plans 

* How effective are the company's Performance Improvement Plans (PIP's)?

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

* What is the overall diversity profile of the company?
* Which recruiting sources promote diversity?
* Is compensation at the company equitable between identity groups?
