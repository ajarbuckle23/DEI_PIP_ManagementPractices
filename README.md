# DEI, PIP, and Management Analyses Project 

## Summary

In this project, I made use of a fictitious employee dataset to answer critical business questions across several topics. 

**Management Practices**

* How do and job performance, engagement levels, and satisfaction levels vary for employees under different managers?

**Performance Improvement Plans**

* How effective are the company's Performance Improvement Plans (PIP's)?

**Diversity, and Equity**

* What is the overall diversity profile of the company?
* Which recruiting sources promote diversity?
* Is compensation at the company equitable between identity groups?

The entire project is contained in the attached Jupyter notebook, where I begin by programmatically collecting the data from the Kaggle website; then and manipulate the dataset to prepare it for analysis; perform some exploratory data analysis that provided other valuable insights into the company's workforce; and finally answer the specific business questions posed above. The notebook has many visualizations and comments that make it easy to follow my thought process.
